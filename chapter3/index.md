## Implicit Ratings and Item Based Filtering
This chapter starts with a discussion of the types of user ratings we can use. Users can explicitly give ratings (thumbs up, thumbs down, 5 stars, or whatever) or they can rate products implicitly–if they buy an mp3 from Amazon, we can view that purchase as a ‘like’ rating.

### Python code

There is only one Python file for this chapter: [recommender3.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacharski/pg2dm-python/master/ch3/recommender3.py)


### Data

In addition to the data set introduced in chapter 2, this chapter uses the MovieLens dataset available from [www.grouplens.org](http://grouplens.org) The dataset used in this chapter is the smallest one on that site–the 100,000 rating one.
